# MAVeD
## MilanverDatabase
### Adrian Bedregal, 2020

MilanverDatabase, aka MAVeD, is a DBMS that focus on the Single Instance paradigm, since it holds a set of batches that are not uniformly distributed, but randomly distributed because they have the data as a set of unordered nodes, like a Heap.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to run MAVeD you must have the following installed:

```
Windows OS
Visual C++ Distributions
Microsoft C++ Build Tools (MSVC compiler)
```

### Installing

First, suposing that you fulfilled the prerequisites, start by opening a Microsoft C++ Build Tools command prompt (i.e. x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019) and navigate
until you reach the directory where you downloaded MAVeD. Then run the ./make.bat file to compile everything.

```
cd .../MAVeD/
./make.bat
```

## Running the tests and Deployment

Since these are the initial phases of the DBMS, it can be deployed just by executing the main.exe to initialize the tests.
It's important to know that it just works for Win64 Operative Systems at the moment.
